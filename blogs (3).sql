Lorem Ipsum has been the industry''s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. ', 'God is love and has demonstrated that love in everything that he does. Paul compares faith, hope, and love, and concludes that "the greatest of these is love" ( 1 Cor 13:13 ).\r\n\r\n"God Is Love."Agape [ajgavph], the love theme of the Bible, can only be defined by the nature of God. John affirms that "God is love" ( 1 John 4:8 ). God does not merely love; he is love. Everything that God does flows from his love.\r\n\r\nJohn emphasizes repeatedly that God the Father loves the Son ( John 5:20 ; John 17:23 John 17:26 ) and that the Son loves the Father ( John 14:31 ). Because the Father loves the Son, he made his will known to him. Jesus in turn demonstrated his love to the Father through his submission and obedience.\r\n\r\nThe theme of the entire Bible is the self-revelation of the God of love. In the garden of Eden, God commanded that "you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat of it you will surely die" ( Gen 2:17 ). We are not prepared, then, when God looks for Adam after his sin, calling out "Where are you?" God seeks Adam, not to put him to death, but to reestablish a relationship with him. God, the Lover, will not allow sin to stand between him and his creature. He personally bridges the gap.\r\n\r\nThat seeking and bridging reaches its pinnacle when God sends his Son into the world to rescue sinners and to provide them with eternal life ( John 3:16 ; Rom 5:7-8 ; Eph 2:1-5 ). John declares, "This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us" ( 1 John 3:16 ). God''s love is not based on the merit of the recipient ( Deut 7:7-8 ; Rom 5:7-8 ). Because he is love, God is not willing that any person should perish, but wills that everyone repent and live ( Ezek 18:32 ; 2 Peter 3:9 ).', 'God''s will', 'img/God''swill.jpg', '2017-03-16 09:50:23'),

No one could have prepared you for the blow of losing the connection with another human being. Whether you decided to end the relationship or it was ended for you by a break up or death, you may experience symptoms of grief and periodic despair. It is not easy finding a path to true intimacy and then severing that bond with minimal impact. The foundation of love is sharing, trust, and intimacy. Inherent in that bond is a willingness to be vulnerable. Intimate vulnerability allows your thoughts and emotions to be expressed in the context of shared experience. When circumstances no longer provide a trusting environment for a bonding love, the separation can feel devastating.</p>\r\n<p>In many cases, the partner is also the best friend. Coping with relationship loss can be particularly difficult if the couple has relied on each other as best friends. By having limited options to confide in, the &lsquo;newly&rsquo; single person may feel isolated, lonely, and frustrated.</p>\r\n<p>It took work to develop a bond between two people. With that bond being severed, it will take time to rebuild. If you find yourself watching the telephone in hopes of getting a call or listening to romantic songs as you reminisce about your ex and the way it &lsquo;could have been&rsquo;, you may be holding on and need to incorporate some strategies for transitioning to your new life of independence.</p>\r\n<h2>Coping with the Loss</h2>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>It is important to make time for the healing process.</strong>&nbsp;Too often, we are encouraged to be &lsquo;strong&rsquo; and keep it all inside. This method only serves to keep the former loved one on your mind and you frustrated. There needs to be a grieving period. Whether you care to admit it or not, that person did mean a great deal to you at one time. You honor the love that you shared by validating the relationship as a worthwhile experience.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Engage in &lsquo;self-help&rsquo; practices</strong>. Some people benefit from reading self-help books. Others enjoy creative writing as a means of healing and expression. Find a way that complements your personality and do it! Whether it&rsquo;s reading, writing, or singing, expressing your feelings is a great way to learn about yourself and your current needs.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Realize that you might not be functioning at your best right now.</strong>&nbsp;Give yourself some space to &lsquo;be&rsquo; without pressure or high demands. Efforts to organize the more routine activities of your life may be helpful to streamlining your energy expenditure. Do the activities that you need to and leave your remaining time for nurturing, self-discovery, and healing.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Mobilize your support system.</strong>&nbsp;Spending time with affirming friends is essential at this time. In addition to venting your emotions as you sort through your next step in life, you can share the relationship&rsquo;s shortcomings. If this was an addictive relationship, your friends can help you avoid an unhealthy reconciliation by providing true accounts of the circumstances.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Use this time for self-renewal.</strong>&nbsp;When you are involved in a relationship, the other person receives your attention and focus. Being single offers you the opportunity to redirect that attention to yourself. Connect with areas of your life that have been neglected as a result of the relationship. Recharge your body through exercise. Reflect on your spiritual awareness and life journey. Replenish by engaging with nature. Renew your commitment to yourself to be the best person possible.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Spend some time each day on something pleasurable.</strong>&nbsp;It is important to enjoy key aspects of your life while other components are mending.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Highlight the reasons that the relationship was less than perfect.</strong>&nbsp;During times when loneliness sets in and the reason why the relationship ended may not be so clear, it may be helpful to review your thoughts from a more focused period.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Most research indicates that it takes about half the time the relationship existed in order to heal from the pain. Even then, many carry a portion of the painful memories for longer periods of time. Time does help ease the discomfort of relationship loss. However, it usually takes a while to feel better. Remembering the suggestions above may help as you patiently discover the relationship with yourself again.</p>\r\n<p>Should you need some assistance in recovering from the loss of a relationship, you may want to consult with a professional counselor in your geographical area.

You may feel alone yet unwilling to tell anyone thereâ€™s depression in your household, or you may simply wonder when the sparkle and joy, the humor and fun seeped out of your relationship.\r\n\r\nIf thereâ€™s depression in your marriage, itâ€™s time to actâ€”for your partner and yourself. Waiting increases the chances that your relationship wonâ€™t last; depressed couples are nine times more likely to divorce.

They may feel too lethargic or withdrawn or may think they can fix it alone.</p>\n<p>If you notice that your spouse isn&rsquo;t acting, feeling, or thinking as he or she normally does, ask yourself if it could be depression, but don&rsquo;t stop there. Depression may be the reason your spouse is working extremely long hours, drinking too much, using recreational drugs, or looking for thrills in risky activities. It can also look different in men and women.</p>\n<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t wait for your spouse to hit bottom.</strong>&nbsp;Letting a depressed person sink low before offering help is an old-school approach borrowed from the early days of alcohol- and drug-addiction treatment. But the reasoning behind it is flawed and dangerous. Long-term depression is harder on your marriage, tougher to treat, and more likely to recur, and it leaves its victim in despair. The most chilling risk: It leaves open the very real possibility of suicide. About 60 percent of people who attempt suicide have major or minor depression or another mood disorder&mdash;and depressed men are four times more likely than depressed women to take their own lives.</p>\n<p><strong>Break the ice gently yet firmly.</strong>&nbsp;If you suspect your partner is depressed, don&rsquo;t blurt out a layperson&rsquo;s diagnosis: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re depressed!&rdquo; or announce: &ldquo;You better get help!&rdquo; In order to begin the process of healing, approach your spouse with concern and with an action plan. You might say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m concerned about how feeling tired and losing your appetite are affecting you. You deserve to feel better. Our doctor may be able to help you, and I&rsquo;d like to arrange a time when we can meet with him. Next week, I can go on Wednesday or Friday. What&rsquo;s good for you?&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>Get a diagnosis&mdash;together.</strong>&nbsp;Dozens of health conditions&mdash;including heart disease, diabetes, lupus, viral infections, and chronic pain&mdash;can trigger the same symptoms as depression. So can scores of prescription medications, including some birth-control pills and drugs that treat acne, herpes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and cancer. Your family doctor can rule out underlying causes and decide whether or not it&rsquo;s really depression.</p>\n<p>Ask your spouse if it&rsquo;s okay for you to attend this evaluation. &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re down that low, you may not be able to express what&rsquo;s going on or even realize what all your symptoms are,&rdquo; Emily Scott-Lowe notes. &ldquo;And you may not be able to concentrate on the treatment recommendations your doctor is making. You need an ally in the room.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>Know that the odds are in your favor.</strong>&nbsp;As we noted, the success rate of depression treatment is as high as 90 percent. Usually the road back is relatively simple: antidepressants, counseling, or a combination of the two. That said, recovery may take time and patience. There may be an initial trial-and-error period while you try various antidepressants or see whether various therapy techniques, such as cognitive behavioral therapy and interpersonal counseling, are helpful. The results are worth it.</p>', 'download (3).jpg', 'img/download (3).jpg', '2017-03-22 13:18:36'),

Here''s what to look for and how to take action.', '<p>When one spouse is depressed, a marriage is depressed. This illness erodes emotional and sexual intimacy and suffuses a relationship with pessimism and resentment, anger and isolation. Even the sunniest, most capable partner can be pulled into depression&rsquo;s strong undertow: You may be overwhelmed by extra household chores that your partner is too lethargic to finish, resentful because your spouse won&rsquo;t just snap out of it, or feel that you&rsquo;re somehow to blame for the illness itself. You may feel alone yet unwilling to tell anyone there&rsquo;s depression in your household, or you may simply wonder when the sparkle and joy, the humor and fun seeped out of your relationship.</p> <p>If there&rsquo;s depression in your marriage, it&rsquo;s time to act&mdash;for your partner and yourself. Waiting increases the chances that your relationship won&rsquo;t last; depressed couples are nine times more likely to divorce. And trying to fight or make peace with this often misunderstood illness on your own raises risks for both of you. The longer a nondepressed spouse lives with a depressed partner, the higher his or her own risks for depression. The deeper a depressed spouse sinks, the tougher it may be to finally treat the depression&mdash;and the greater the risk for alcoholism, drug abuse, violence, and even suicide. The stakes are high, but the odds are that things will improve.</p> <p>Remember, you&rsquo;re not alone. An estimated 19 million Americans are currently going through depression. In the&nbsp;<em>Reader&rsquo;s Digest Marriage in America Survey</em>, 42 percent of respondents named depression as a major challenge in their relationships. It&rsquo;s not surprising that most said this insidious illness had a negative effect on them. But there was an unexpected ray of hope: One in four said depression had a positive outcome for their marriages. &ldquo;Getting diagnosed and treated makes all the difference,&rdquo; says Emily Scott-Lowe, Ph.D., an assistant visiting professor of social work at Pepperdine University, who leads workshops across the country about depression and marriage with her husband, Dennis Lowe, Ph.D., a psychologist and director of Pepperdine&rsquo;s Center for the Family. &ldquo;Just 33 percent of people with depression seek and get help.

Almost everyone gets some relief.&rdquo;</p> <div class="mobile-hide">&nbsp;</div> <p>Depression isn&rsquo;t a choice or a little case of the blues. It&rsquo;s a physical illness as serious and life-altering as diabetes, heart disease, or arthritis. A depressed spouse can&rsquo;t just &ldquo;snap out of it&rdquo; or &ldquo;get on with life.&rdquo; The reason: Depression is marked by dramatic shifts in brain chemistry that alter mood, thoughts, sleep, appetite, and energy levels. Genetics usually make many of us susceptible to depression; any number of factors can trigger the slide, including prolonged or severe stress, financial problems, a big loss or change in your life, the birth of a child, parenthood, and even some health conditions and prescription drugs. Marriage itself even raises your risk: Up to 1 in 10 brides experience &ldquo;postnuptial depression&rdquo; in the months after the wedding. And up to half of all women and men in unhappy marriages may be depressed, perhaps due to marriage problems (though some experts suspect that undiagnosed depression is behind the problems).</p> <p class="continues-below">CONTENT CONTINUES BELOW AD</p> <div id="rdg_health_EverydayWellness_how_to_cope_with_a_depressed_spouse-auto-gen-id-2" class="adunit ad-in-article display-block" data-dimensions="300x250,320x50,300x50" data-size-mapping="in-article" data-adunit="rdg/health/EverydayWellness/how-to-cope-with-a-depressed-spouse" data-targeting="{&quot;pos&quot;:&quot;middle&quot;,&quot;location&quot;:&quot;middle_article_no_aj&quot;}" data-google-query-id="CI3k4fTj6dICFdATGwodzt8LSA"> <div id="google_ads_iframe_/6178/rdg/health/EverydayWellness/how-to-cope-with-a-depressed-spouse_1__container__"><iframe id="google_ads_iframe_/6178/rdg/health/EverydayWellness/how-to-cope-with-a-depressed-spouse_1" title="3rd party ad content" src="http://tpc.googlesyndication.com/safeframe/1-0-6/html/container.html" name="" width="300" height="250" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" data-is-safeframe="true"></iframe></div> </div> <p>If you think your partner may be depressed, your first step is to pay attention to the clues&mdash;and help him or her get a diagnosis and treatment.

Depression may be the reason your spouse is working extremely long hours, drinking too much, using recreational drugs, or looking for thrills in risky activities. It can also look different in men and women.</p> <p><strong>Don&rsquo;t wait for your spouse to hit bottom.</strong>&nbsp;Letting a depressed person sink low before offering help is an old-school approach borrowed from the early days of alcohol- and drug-addiction treatment. But the reasoning behind it is flawed and dangerous. Long-term depression is harder on your marriage, tougher to treat, and more likely to recur, and it leaves its victim in despair. The most chilling risk: It leaves open the very real possibility of suicide. About 60 percent of people who attempt suicide have major or minor depression or another mood disorder&mdash;and depressed men are four times more likely than depressed women to take their own lives.</p> <p><strong>Break the ice gently yet firmly.</strong>&nbsp;If you suspect your partner is depressed, don&rsquo;t blurt out a layperson&rsquo;s diagnosis: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re depressed!&rdquo; or announce: &ldquo;You better get help!&rdquo; In order to begin the process of healing, approach your spouse with concern and with an action plan. You might say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m concerned about how feeling tired and losing your appetite are affecting you. You deserve to feel better. Our doctor may be able to help you, and I&rsquo;d like to arrange a time when we can meet with him. Next week, I can go on Wednesday or Friday. What&rsquo;s good for you?&rdquo;</p> <p><strong>Get a diagnosis&mdash;together.</strong>&nbsp;Dozens of health conditions&mdash;including heart disease, diabetes, lupus, viral infections, and chronic pain&mdash;can trigger the same symptoms as depression. So can scores of prescription medications, including some birth-control pills and drugs that treat acne, herpes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and cancer. Your family doctor can rule out underlying causes and decide whether or not it&rsquo;s really depression.</p> <p>Ask your spouse if it&rsquo;s okay for you to attend this evaluation. &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re down that low, you may not be able to express what&rsquo;s going on or even realize what all your symptoms are,&rdquo; Emily Scott-Lowe notes. &ldquo;And you may not be able to concentrate on the treatment recommendations your doctor is making. You need an ally in the room.&rdquo;</p> <p><strong>Know that the odds are in your favor.</strong>&nbsp;As we noted, the success rate of depression treatment is as high as 90 percent. Usually the road back is relatively simple: antidepressants, counseling, or a combination of the two. That said, recovery may take time and patience. There may be an initial trial-and-error period while you try various antidepressants or see whether various therapy techniques, such as cognitive behavioral therapy and interpersonal counseling, are helpful.

Here''s what to look for and how to take action.', 'They might be 30, or 75. They come in all colors, shapes, sizes and income brackets. It doesn’t matter how long they’ve been together. Whatever the demographics, when you see a happy couple, you just know it!\n\nHow do these couples stay in love, in good times and in bad? Fortunately, the answer isn’t through luck or chance. As a result of hard work and commitment, they figure out the importance of the following relationship “musts.” Because few couples know about all of the musts, I think of them as the relationship “secrets.”\n\nHappy Couples and Their Secrets\n\n1. Develop a realistic view of committed relationships.\n\nRecognize that the crazy infatuation you experienced when your romance was new won’t last. A deeper, richer relationship, and one that should still include romance, will replace it. A long-term relationship has ups and downs, and expecting it will be all sunny and roses all the time is unrealistic.\n\n2. Work on the relationship.\n\nAn untended garden develops weeds that can ultimately kill even the heartiest plants. And so it is with relationships. It is important to address problems and misunderstandings immediately. Some people believe good relationships just happen naturally. The truth is that a good relationship, like anything you want to succeed in life, must be worked on and tended to on a regular basis. Neglect the relationship, and it will often go downhill.\n\n3. Spend time together.\n\nThere is no substitute for shared quality time. When you make a point of being together, without kids, pets and other interruptions, you will form a bond that will get you through life’s rough spots. Time spent together should be doing a shared activity, not just watching television.\n\n4. Make room for “separateness.”\n\nPerhaps going against conventional wisdom, spending time apart is also an important component of a happy relationship. It is healthy to have some separate interests and activities and to come back to the relationship refreshed and ready to share your experiences. Missing your partner helps remind you how important he or she is to you.\n\n5. Make the most of your differences.\n\nStop and think: What most attracted you to your partner at the beginning? I’ll almost guarantee that it was exactly the thing that drives you most insane today. Take a fresh look at these differences. Try to focus on their positive aspects and find an appreciation for those exact things that make the two of you different from one another. It’s likely that your differences balance one another out and make you a great team.\n\n6. Don’t expect your partner to change; but at the same time give them more of what they want.\n\nIf both you and your partner stop trying to change each other, you will eliminate the source of most of your arguments. At the same time, each of you should focus on giving one another more of what you know the other person wants, even if it doesn’t come naturally. For instance, instead of complaining how your partner never cleans out the dishwasher, try just doing it yourself once in awhile without complaint. Your partner will likely notice your effort and make more of an effort themselves around the house. If you do both of these things at once you’ve got a winning plan!\n\n7. Accept that some problems can’t be solved.\n\nThere may be issues upon which you cannot agree. Rather than expending wasted energy, agree to disagree, and attempt to compromise or to work around the issue. Two people cannot spend years together without having legitimate areas of disagreement. The test of a happy relationship is how they choose to work through such issues — through compromise, change, or finding it’s just not that important to stew over.\n\n8. Communicate!\n\nLack of communication is the number one reason even good relationships fail. And here is a useful format for doing so, especially when dealing with incendiary topics: Listen to your partner’s position, without interrupting him or her. Just listen. When he or she is finished, summarize what you heard him or her say. If you can, empathize with your significant other even though you don’t agree. This will take your partner off of the defensive, and make it easier for them to hear your thoughts and feelings. It’s hard to argue when you use this format, and best of all, you may come up with an understanding or a solution.\n\n9. Honesty is essential.\n\nYou may share with your partner the things he or she doesn’t want to hear. Better this than to have him or her doubt your honesty. Mistrust is one of the key deal breakers in relationships. And once trust is lost or broken, it can take a very long time to re-establish it in the relationship.The happiest couples are the ones where honesty is as natural and every day as breathing.\n\n10. Respect your partner, and don’t take him or her for granted.\n\nTreating your sweetheart with respect is likely to get you the same in return. And regularly reminding them how much they mean to you will enrich your relationship in indescribable ways. When you say, “I love you,” pause for a moment to really mean it. And don’t be afraid to express your feelings of appreciation with your partner — he or she will be thankful that you did.\n\nMaking these secrets an integral part of your relationship won’t be easy. In fact, your efforts may initially seem like planted seeds that never come up. If you maintain your efforts, however, you will likely reap what you sow.\n\n\n\nRelated Content from Our Sponsors\n Powered by Revconten', 'Chocolate-Birthday-Cake-Design-Black-Forest.jpg', 'img/Chocolate-Birthday-Cake-Design-Black-Forest.jpg', '2017-03-22 13:40:00');

Here''s what to look for and how to take action.', 'There have been a thousand or more articles written about how to have a successful long-term relationship or marriage, but none that seem to capture some of the core ingredients I’ve found important in relationships. So here’s the straight dope, from my experience.\n\nBefore I begin, however, it’s important to dispel a common relationship myth — relationships are (or should be) easy. That is simply not true. The grass always looks greener in other people’s lives, because few people share the truth of the amount of work that goes into relationships (hence why 50% of marriages end in divorce). Relationships — even the best relationships in the world — require constant attention, nurturing, and work. If you can understand and accept the need for constant attention and work in your relationship, you’re started in the right direction.\n\n1. Compromise\n\nRelationships are about not only taking, but also giving. If you find yourself not giving very much, or feeling resentful of how much you give and how little you receive back, you may be in an unequal relationship where one side is taking more than they are giving.\n\nFor instance, couples sometimes mistakenly believe that “love” will help them deal with any issue that comes up, and that if the other person truly loved you, they would just do as you ask. But people are independent with their own unique needs and personalities. Just because we found someone we want to spend our lives with doesn’t mean we give up our own identity in the process.\n\n2. Communicate\n\nRelationships live and die not by the sword, but by the amount of discussion. If two people can’t find a way to openly and honestly communicate their needs and feelings to one another, the relationship doesn’t stand much of a chance long-term. Couples must find a way to communicate regularly, openly, and directly.\n\nThis doesn’t mean waiting for an argument to tell your significant other how much he bothers you with his throwing his clothes on the floor instead of the hamper. It means telling him when you feel the need to, and to do so in a manner that is respectful but assertive.\n\n3. Choose Your Battles Carefully\n\nAfter marriage or when two people move in together, couples tend to discover pretty much the same thing no matter who they are – that they are two different people and living together is harder than anyone ever told them. Love conquers a lot of things, but it is no match for living day-in and day-out with another human being (especially if you’ve spent years on your own).\n\nPrepare yourself for this challenge by choosing what arguments you want to turn into a full blown battle. For instance, do you really want to start a fight over the toothpaste cap or how clean the shower is? Or would you rather reserve your energy for the discussions over finances, kids, and career paths (you know, the things that might really matter to a person). Too many couples fight and bicker over the dumbest things, especially when put into context of issues of true importance.', 'Chocolate-Birthday-Cake-Design-Black-Forest.jpg', 'img/Chocolate-Birthday-Cake-Design-Black-Forest.jpg', '2017-03-22 13:39:52'),

About 60 percent of people who attempt suicide have major or minor depression or another mood disorder—and depressed men are four times more likely than depressed women to take their own lives.\n\nBreak the ice gently yet firmly. If you suspect your partner is depressed, don’t blurt out a layperson’s diagnosis: “You’re depressed!” or announce: “You better get help!” In order to begin the process of healing, approach your spouse with concern and with an action plan. You might say, “I’m concerned about how feeling tired and losing your appetite are affecting you. You deserve to feel better. Our doctor may be able to help you, and I’d like to arrange a time when we can meet with him. Next week, I can go on Wednesday or Friday. What’s good for you?”\n\nGet a diagnosis—together. Dozens of health conditions—including heart disease, diabetes, lupus, viral infections, and chronic pain—can trigger the same symptoms as depression. So can scores of prescription medications, including some birth-control pills and drugs that treat acne, herpes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and cancer. Your family doctor can rule out underlying causes and decide whether or not it’s really depression.\n\nAsk your spouse if it’s okay for you to attend this evaluation. “When you’re down that low, you may not be able to express what’s going on or even realize what all your symptoms are,” Emily Scott-Lowe notes. “And you may not be able to concentrate on the treatment recommendations your doctor is making. You need an ally in the room.”\n\nKnow that the odds are in your favor. As we noted, the success rate of depression treatment is as high as 90 percent. Usually the road back is relatively simple: antidepressants, counseling, or a combination of the two. That said, recovery may take time and patience. There may be an initial trial-and-error period while you try various antidepressants or see whether various therapy techniques, such as cognitive behavioral therapy and interpersonal counseling, are helpful. The results are worth it.', 'Chocolate-Birthday-Cake-Design-Black-Forest.jpg', 'img/Chocolate-Birthday-Cake-Design-Black-Forest.jpg', '2017-03-22 13:37:58'),
(26, 'celebrating your love ', 'Loved one Birthday', 'When one spouse is depressed, a marriage is depressed. This illness erodes emotional and sexual intimacy and suffuses a relationship with pessimism and resentment, anger and isolation. Even the sunniest, most capable partner can be pulled into depression’s strong undertow: You may be overwhelmed by extra household chores that your partner is too lethargic to finish, resentful because your spouse won’t just snap out of it, or feel that you’re somehow to blame for the illness itself. You may feel alone yet unwilling to tell anyone there’s depression in your household, or you may simply wonder when the sparkle and joy, the humor and fun seeped out of your relationship.\n\nIf there’s depression in your marriage, it’s time to act—for your partner and yourself. Waiting increases the chances that your relationship won’t last; depressed couples are nine times more likely to divorce. And trying to fight or make peace with this often misunderstood illness on your own raises risks for both of you. The longer a nondepressed spouse lives with a depressed partner, the higher his or her own risks for depression. The deeper a depressed spouse sinks, the tougher it may be to finally treat the depression—and the greater the risk for alcoholism, drug abuse, violence, and even suicide. The stakes are high, but the odds are that things will improve.\n\nRemember, you’re not alone. An estimated 19 million Americans are currently going through depression. In the Reader’s Digest Marriage in America Survey, 42 percent of respondents named depression as a major challenge in their relationships. It’s not surprising that most said this insidious illness had a negative effect on them. But there was an unexpected ray of hope: One in four said depression had a positive outcome for their marriages. “Getting diagnosed and treated makes all the difference,” says Emily Scott-Lowe, Ph.D., an assistant visiting professor of social work at Pepperdine University, who leads workshops across the country about depression and marriage with her husband, Dennis Lowe, Ph.D., a psychologist and director of Pepperdine’s Center for the Family. “Just 33 percent of people with depression seek and get help. But when you do, your chances for significant improvement are 80 to 90 percent. Almost everyone gets some relief.”\n\nDepression isn’t a choice or a little case of the blues. It’s a physical illness as serious and life-altering as diabetes, heart disease, or arthritis. A depressed spouse can’t just “snap out of it” or “get on with life.” The reason: Depression is marked by dramatic shifts in brain chemistry that alter mood, thoughts, sleep, appetite, and energy levels. Genetics usually make many of us susceptible to depression; any number of factors can trigger the slide, including prolonged or severe stress, financial problems, a big loss or change in your life, the birth of a child, parenthood, and even some health conditions and prescription drugs. Marriage itself even raises your risk: Up to 1 in 10 brides experience “postnuptial depression” in the months after the wedding. And up to half of all women and men in unhappy marriages may be depressed, perhaps due to marriage problems (though some experts suspect that undiagnosed depression is behind the problems).\n\nCONTENT CONTINUES BELOW AD\n\nIf you think your partner may be depressed, your first step is to pay attention to the clues—and help him or her get a diagnosis and treatment. These steps can help.\n\nwhy men say no to sex, depressedBe alert to small changes. Depression can come on slowly, almost imperceptibly. “You look for all types of other explanations—we just had a new baby, it’s a tough time at work, it’s a phase,” Emily Scott-Lowe notes. “It can take a while to see the pattern or to be ready to accept that depression might be the cause.”\n\nOften it’s up to the nondepressed spouse to take the lead: The illness itself often prevents depressed people from recognizing that something’s wrong or seeking help. They may feel too lethargic or withdrawn or may think they can fix it alone.\n\nIf you notice that your spouse isn’t acting, feeling, or thinking as he or she normally does, ask yourself if it could be depression, but don’t stop there. Depression may be the reason your spouse is working extremely long hours, drinking too much, using recreational drugs, or looking for thrills in risky activities. It can also look different in men and women.\n\nDon’t wait for your spouse to hit bottom. Letting a depressed person sink low before offering help is an old-school approach borrowed from the early days of alcohol- and drug-addiction treatment. But the reasoning behind it is flawed and dangerous. Long-term depression is harder on your marriage, tougher to treat, and more likely to recur, and it leaves its victim in despair. The most chilling risk: It leaves open the very real possibility of suicide. About 60 percent of people who attempt suicide have major or minor depression or another mood disorder—and depressed men are four times more likely than depressed women to take their own lives.\n\nBreak the ice gently yet firmly.

Whatever the demographics, when you see a happy couple, you just know it!\r\nHow do these couples stay in love, in good times and in bad?', '<article id="post-687" class="post-single h-entry post-687 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-family category-general category-relationships has_thumb">\r\n<div class="post-content">\r\n<div class="entry-content">\r\n<p>They might be 30, or 75. They come in all colors, shapes, sizes and income brackets. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how long they&rsquo;ve been together. Whatever the demographics, when you see a happy couple, you just know it!</p>\r\n<div align="center">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p>How do these couples stay in love, in good times and in bad? Fortunately, the answer isn&rsquo;t through luck or chance. As a result of hard work and commitment, they figure out the importance of the following relationship &ldquo;musts.&rdquo; Because few couples know about all of the musts, I think of them as the relationship &ldquo;secrets.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<h3>Happy Couples and Their Secrets</h3>\r\n<p><strong>1. Develop a realistic view of committed relationships.</strong></p>\r\n<p>Recognize that the crazy infatuation you experienced when your romance was new won&rsquo;t last. A deeper, richer relationship, and one that should still include romance, will replace it. A long-term relationship has ups&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;downs, and expecting it will be all sunny and roses all the time is unrealistic.</p>\r\n<p><strong>2. Work on the relationship.</strong></p>\r\n<p>An untended garden develops weeds that can ultimately kill even the heartiest plants. And so it is with relationships. It is important to address problems and misunderstandings immediately. Some people believe good relationships just happen naturally. The truth is that a good relationship, like anything you want to succeed in life, must be worked on and tended to on a regular basis. Neglect the relationship, and it will often go downhill.</p>\r\n<p><strong>3. Spend time together.</strong></p>\r\n<div align="center">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p>There is no substitute for shared&nbsp;<em>quality</em>&nbsp;time. When you make a point of being together, without kids, pets and other interruptions, you will form a bond that will get you through life&rsquo;s rough spots. Time spent together should be doing a shared activity, not just watching television.</p>\r\n<p><strong>4. Make room for &ldquo;separateness.&rdquo;</strong></p>\r\n<p>Perhaps going against conventional wisdom, spending time apart is also an important component of a happy relationship. It is healthy to have some separate interests and activities and to come back to the relationship refreshed and ready to share your experiences. Missing your partner helps remind you how important he or she is to you.</p>\r\n<p><strong>5. Make the most of your differences.</strong></p>\r\n<p>Stop and think: What most attracted you to your partner at the beginning? I&rsquo;ll almost guarantee that it was exactly the thing that drives you most insane today. Take a fresh look at these differences. Try to focus on their positive aspects and find an appreciation for those exact things that make the two of you different from one another. It&rsquo;s likely that your differences balance one another out and make you a great team.</p>\r\n<p><strong>6. Don&rsquo;t expect your partner to change; but at the same time give them more of what they want.</strong></p>\r\n<p>If both you and your partner stop trying to change each other, you will eliminate the source of most of your arguments. At the same time, each of you should focus on giving one another more of what you know the other person wants, even if it doesn&rsquo;t come naturally. For instance, instead of complaining how your partner never cleans out the dishwasher, try just doing it yourself once in awhile without complaint. Your partner will likely notice your effort and make more of an effort themselves around the house. If you do both of these things at once you&rsquo;ve got a winning plan!</p>\r\n<p><strong>7. Accept that some problems can&rsquo;t be solved.</strong></p>\r\n<p>There may be issues upon which you cannot agree. Rather than expending wasted energy, agree to disagree, and attempt to compromise or to work around the issue. Two people cannot spend years together without having legitimate areas of disagreement. The test of a happy relationship is how they choose to work through such issues &mdash; through compromise, change, or finding it&rsquo;s just not that important to stew over.</p>\r\n<p><strong>8. Communicate!</strong></p>\r\n<p>Lack of communication is the number one reason even good relationships fail. And here is a useful format for doing so, especially when dealing with incendiary topics:&nbsp;<strong>Listen</strong>&nbsp;to your partner&rsquo;s position, without interrupting him or her. Just listen. When he or she is finished, summarize what you heard him or her say. If you can, empathize with your significant other even though you don&rsquo;t agree. This will take your partner off of the defensive, and make it easier for them to hear your thoughts and feelings. It&rsquo;s hard to argue when you use this format, and best of all, you may come up with an understanding or a solution.</p>\r\n<p><strong>9. Honesty is essential.</strong></p>\r\n<p>You may share with your partner the things he or she doesn&rsquo;t want to hear. Better this than to have him or her doubt your honesty. Mistrust is one of the key deal breakers in relationships. And once trust is lost or broken, it can take a very long time to re-establish it in the relationship.The happiest couples are the ones where honesty is as natural and every day as breathing.</p>\r\n<p><strong>10. Respect your partner, and don&rsquo;t take him or her for granted.</strong></p>\r\n<p>Treating your sweetheart with respect is likely to get you the same in return. And regularly reminding them how much they mean to you will enrich your relationship in indescribable ways. When you say, &ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; pause for a moment to really mean it. And don&rsquo;t be afraid to express your feelings of appreciation with your partner &mdash; he or she will be thankful that you did.</p>\r\n<p>Making these secrets an integral part of your relationship won&rsquo;t be easy. In fact, your efforts may initially seem like planted seeds that never come up. If you maintain your efforts, however, you will likely reap what you sow.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</article>\r\n<div class="addthis_sharing_toolbox" data-url="https://psychcentral.com/lib/the-10-secrets-of-happy-couples/">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div id="wrelated" class="related">\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div id="whitebox"><span class="author">Related Content from Our Sponsors</span><br />\r\n<div id="rcjsload_8f15be">\r\n<div id="rc_w_742514901784559032">\r\n<div class="rc-wc rc-bp rc-uid-7425 rc-g-dl" data-rcp="eyJ3IjoiNzQyNSIsInQiOiJyY185MTciLCJjIjoiMTQ5MDE3ODQ1MDY2MyIsIndpZHRoIjoiMTM2NiIsInJlZmVyZXIiOiJodHRwczpcL1wvd3d3Lmdvb2dsZS5jb21cLyJ9" data-rct="6" data-rc-g-dl="6" data-rc-g-d="6" data-rc-g-t="6" data-rc-g-p="6" data-id="7425" data-original_load="eyJzcG9uc29yZWQiOlsxNzIyOTQ2LDE3ODExMTEsMTgwMTcwM10sInRyZW5kaW5nIjpbMTgzNDQ4NSw3OTcwODQsNTM4NTYxXX0=" data-refresh="0" data-refresh-int="60000" data-view="uTb2%2FLoC06YHEo8CRBnpVX%2Fga%2B8Z%2FmSKrviXdQn%2FrKY3UPvWpusp%2Fi32I8MSGI6GjK0avjUZKYDjrXJnXoycQK%2BN4Gs8EC2DXGcdfIM%2BQUfvjkSQZzbBS7TLmWPsbOtdbiEMX4r9W%2BWYB42Y948akSDPhOklgg6vNI9pAVZKglDP9ZjZAgtQB5H8HKavGyYC1rNtksjca4%2BfjY6U7UDBYPh7JPcRpTHIquDIrvt%2FTfovjidETzIi0gyoRMylUFhfOxoUOLaeHyeu2kM0sbv7KaSgDsFS6r1SOEFSRB708y4MSUgFu8nUvC%2Fi6IcdTVEn5rnTH0afoQgFKPnHlWSNd0O4jyDL5%2F7mh%2BvpKAZz%2BOiPd5LudZZP3fsJmuqYV53cDLADL%2Fin7s3zukCBkQgqK%2BrsMGCLREQfRWNHQttbD5bmS5uLMwA6NP%2B8i4KxYDnyHx3GFK6ZtFPcbB8NDklcJS7dloCS%2BJd3T7jExDQsECGNOxljL6r4bJmAgxShAEsaBQMtptWFQlDF%2F0FGkPzyK3B7Tqt7NQNTduC0zx%2BWItKLr%2F800q0M3efearc5f5lqVwZQwHYSNhCXgmV9Rdml5yGvzSsY1btyLHxuXFr0FWvH7og6MuNEsdiiDIIQpzeg4v6Kyy7Fa9wGAIIAGpSn7q8g7Rr3zFoE7T5Jjh1%2Bw2OTBCFXFosP8z26K3SzXcbHLAbRQkJseH51fu8kaL3taOyoFAC%2F60I1KI%2BmtJyPk973J%2F4vl%2BsdbN8f%2FVjdLZOQ68Kvf%2BeqTR2X6qdVAbtHftKCClsccmRl0fc4dN%2BDrNZ3H06sPSOgL01cXpodx888zWYPzEEgZ1fn7ZatT4TkMaOtdJhZDgugjmFOTlXB2HgmGQQLmceSgUL%2Bue%2F%2B0MPQdyZxnssdQWEwt9w4AVmQv9fsWUJ2dntCQVD4D35Ed2vgZTlqfA1VxAxNJPChq3%2F9nv7xCuZLm%2FLGNU7TjAKUb5xM62rxtzR7rwm0KqZ7GONov0ACTbh4UEyG8ld7zYH3zkaI4Q3brC%2BBdAtu6%2BcnuAARSMEl8efsg%2BYygIu71nrk9slYKsnjb6EpFilBuBEPqGYrsppiOvUb483yL8uYkQtxbwFmSmEntjl3qfXwWoH8Kh7J4GoC9MNnGJ7a%2Bb0WLpoNS%2Fsli4yFZvpGujzmGjhfKcThH8Lcpf%2BJuKbtoCY%3D">\r\n<div class="rc-text-top rc-text-right rc-branding rc-bl-powered-by-revcontent">\r\n<div id="hateit" class="hateit sameline" data-text="Personalize This Content" data-position="same">&nbsp;</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<div class="rc-branding-label rc-brand-content">Powered by Revconten</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>', 'banner3.jpg', 'img/banner3.jpg', '2017-03-22 13:33:13'),
